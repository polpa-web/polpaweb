      <!-- FUN FACTS -->
      <div class="fun-facts-container">
        <div class="fun-fact-box">🫀 <strong>Octopuses have three hearts!</strong> How cool is that? This makes them extra hard to conquer romantically. Not only do you have to win their heart. You have to win THREE of them!</div>
        <div class="fun-fact-box">💙 <strong>Their blood is blue!</strong> Thanks to hemocyanin. Truly noble, royal, majestic blue-blooded creatures!</div>
        <div class="fun-fact-box">🎨 <strong>Colour changing pros!</strong> They camouflage to trick the dumb. They are masters of deception, they can turn into a rock or act as seaweed. Huge slay!</div>
        <div class="fun-fact-box">🧠 <strong>Tentacle brains!</strong> Yes, they think with their limbs. Can you imagine thinking through your arm or leg? Extra tentacularly smartissimi!</div>
        <div class="fun-fact-box">🦾 <strong>Rebop!</strong> They can regenerate their tentacles if some evil ugly creature cuts one of them off. Such resilient divas.</div>
        <div class="fun-fact-box">🔓 <strong>Jar escape artists!</strong> They use their zuignaps (🌀) to open jars like Houdini! No one traps POLP in a jar!</div>
        <div class="fun-fact-box">👻 <strong>Transparent stress response!</strong> They go see-through when stressed... honestly, jealous.</div>
        <div class="fun-fact-box">🐝 <strong>Social bees!</strong> Squids are social creatures! They interact by telling each other jokes (usually they are dissing the seahorses) and they even have schools! They are even more educated than the average American citizen, and they like drinking tea at 5 p.m. just like the British. They also have a complex culinary tradition, that includes marine versions of stroopwaffels and lasagne (Italy and the Netherlands are their favorite countries.)</div>
        <div class="fun-fact-box">✒ <strong>Ink poets!</strong> Squids are inky creatures! As previously mentioned they are absolutely cultured and they love using their ink to write poetry. Rumor has it that Homer, the author of the Ilias and the Odyssey, was actually a squid! The talent, the brilliance... absolutely iconic!</div>
        <div class="fun-fact-box">🐙 <strong>Squiddy squiddiness!</strong> "Squiddiness" is a feeling, and you can feel it too! Whenever you are having a lovely time with your fellow partner of squiddiness, you are having a "squiddy time". And that's the most precious feeling in the world. Always cherish the squiddiness in your life! 💓</div>
