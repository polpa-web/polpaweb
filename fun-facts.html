    <h1>SQUIDDY FUN FACTS! 🐙</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>🫀 Octopusses have three hearts! How cool is that? This makes them extra hard to conquer romantically. Not only do you have to win their heart. You have to win THREE of them!</li>
      <li>💙Their blood is blue due to the presence of a protein called hemocyanin, which helps them carry oxygen. They are truly noble creatures!</li>
      <li>🎨 They are squiddy chameleons! They change colour as they please to camouflage and fool the stupid people, pretending to be a rock or whatever!</li>
      <li>🧠 Their brain is in their tentacles! Extra tentacularly smartissimi! Their tentacles are also pretty and full of zuignaps.</li>
      <li>🔓 They can use their zuignaps to unscrew jars! No one traps POLP in a jar!</li>
      <li>👻 When they are stressed, they can become transparent! (I  wish I could do that too and get out of exams)</li>
      <li>✒Squids are inky creatures! They love using their ink to write poetry. In fact, a new theory argues that Homer, the author of the Ilias and the Odyssey, was actually a squid!</li>
